# Dynamic: Floating Image Text

This is the floating component.

## ⚠️ Advanced component

This is an advanced component, and care is required to edit.

Small edits may be possible via the JSON field, but take care not to enter "invalid json" as contentful warns.

**Publishing invalid JSON in Contentful is possible, and will break the component.**

If the component breaks, please roll back to the latest working version.
