				<strong>What&rsquo;s it like to work at Rightpoint?</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Recently Crain&rsquo;s ranked Rightpoint among the &ldquo;Top 20 Best Places to Work in Chicago.&rdquo; Why? In large part because Rightpoint walks the talk in term of its culture. Rightpoint has a set of 7 values and uses them as a compass. In addition, Rightpointers have passion for their work. They want to build something and enjoy solving complex problems every day in a collaborative environment. Our founders wanted to foster a culture where team members feel challenged yet love what they are doing so much so that they envision Rightpoint being the last stop in their career.</p>
			<p>We hire A-Players because we are working on cutting-edge projects and our clients expect solutions that will WOW them. We help some of Chicago&rsquo;s top businesses find solutions to their digital needs. After we deliver our solutions, we ask our clients a very basic question. On a scale of 1-10, &ldquo;How likely would you be to refer us to a friend or colleague?&rdquo; &ndash; We strive for an average of 9, and are currently exceeding that goal. We ask the same question of our employees: &ldquo;On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend Rightpoint to a friend as a place to work?&rdquo; And, we&rsquo;re proud to say that our average score exceeds 9 on that front too.</p>
			<p>Why do the best want to work here? The reasons vary but, for many, it&rsquo;s because they are challenged by their work and because they get to work with some of the most influential companies in Chicago. The icing on the cake is that they also have a great time doing it! We take our work very seriously but ourselves? Not so much. At Rightpoint&rsquo;s offices, conference rooms have names like Hickory, Dickory, and Dock and we have a &ldquo;WOW&rdquo; Wall where Rightpointers and our clients can recognize accomplishments of colleagues by filling out a &ldquo;Holy Sheet!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>What are some other things that add to the texture of Rightpoint? We thrive to give back to the community and have a Compassion Crew that organizes regular events. Our Culture Club ensures that our culture is engrained in everything we do and we stay consistent with our values. Oh, and did we mention we have a Keg in our kitchen where we gather around most Fridays for a &ldquo;Rightpint&rdquo; Happy Hour? And we cater in lunch every other Friday? Those are just a few examples of what makes Rightpoint a truly great place to work.

				<strong>What&rsquo;s it like to work at Rightpoint?</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Recently Crain&rsquo;s ranked Rightpoint among the &ldquo;Top 20 Best Places to Work in Chicago.&rdquo; Why? In large part because Rightpoint walks the talk in term of its culture. Rightpoint has a set of 7 values and uses them as a compass. In addition, Rightpointers have passion for their work. They want to build something and enjoy solving complex problems every day in a collaborative environment. Our founders wanted to foster a culture where team members feel challenged yet love what they are doing so much so that they envision Rightpoint being the last stop in their career.</p>
			<p>We hire A-Players because we are working on cutting-edge projects and our clients expect solutions that will WOW them. We help some of Chicago&rsquo;s top businesses find solutions to their digital needs. After we deliver our solutions, we ask our clients a very basic question. On a scale of 1-10, &ldquo;How likely would you be to refer us to a friend or colleague?&rdquo; &ndash; We strive for an average of 9, and are currently exceeding that goal. We ask the same question of our employees: &ldquo;On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend Rightpoint to a friend as a place to work?&rdquo; And, we&rsquo;re proud to say that our average score exceeds 9 on that front too.</p>
			<p>Why do the best want to work here? The reasons vary but, for many, it&rsquo;s because they are challenged by their work and because they get to work with some of the most influential companies in Chicago. The icing on the cake is that they also have a great time doing it! We take our work very seriously but ourselves? Not so much. At Rightpoint&rsquo;s offices, conference rooms have names like Hickory, Dickory, and Dock and we have a &ldquo;WOW&rdquo; Wall where Rightpointers and our clients can recognize accomplishments of colleagues by filling out a &ldquo;Holy Sheet!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>What are some other things that add to the texture of Rightpoint? We thrive to give back to the community and have a Compassion Crew that organizes regular events. Our Culture Club ensures that our culture is engrained in everything we do and we stay consistent with our values. Oh, and did we mention we have a Keg in our kitchen where we gather around most Fridays for a &ldquo;Rightpint&rdquo; Happy Hour? And we cater in lunch every other Friday? Those are just a few examples of what makes Rightpoint a truly great place to work.

				<strong>What&rsquo;s it like to work at Rightpoint?</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Recently Crain&rsquo;s ranked Rightpoint among the &ldquo;Top 20 Best Places to Work in Chicago.&rdquo; Why? In large part because Rightpoint walks the talk in term of its culture. Rightpoint has a set of 7 values and uses them as a compass. In addition, Rightpointers have passion for their work. They want to build something and enjoy solving complex problems every day in a collaborative environment. Our founders wanted to foster a culture where team members feel challenged yet love what they are doing so much so that they envision Rightpoint being the last stop in their career.</p>
			<p>We hire A-Players because we are working on cutting-edge projects and our clients expect solutions that will WOW them. We help some of Chicago&rsquo;s top businesses find solutions to their digital needs. After we deliver our solutions, we ask our clients a very basic question. On a scale of 1-10, &ldquo;How likely would you be to refer us to a friend or colleague?&rdquo; &ndash; We strive for an average of 9, and are currently exceeding that goal. We ask the same question of our employees: &ldquo;On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend Rightpoint to a friend as a place to work?&rdquo; And, we&rsquo;re proud to say that our average score exceeds 9 on that front too.</p>
			<p>Why do the best want to work here? The reasons vary but, for many, it&rsquo;s because they are challenged by their work and because they get to work with some of the most influential companies in Chicago. The icing on the cake is that they also have a great time doing it! We take our work very seriously but ourselves? Not so much. At Rightpoint&rsquo;s offices, conference rooms have names like Hickory, Dickory, and Dock and we have a &ldquo;WOW&rdquo; Wall where Rightpointers and our clients can recognize accomplishments of colleagues by filling out a &ldquo;Holy Sheet!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>What are some other things that add to the texture of Rightpoint? We thrive to give back to the community and have a Compassion Crew that organizes regular events. Our Culture Club ensures that our culture is engrained in everything we do and we stay consistent with our values. Oh, and did we mention we have a Keg in our kitchen where we gather around most Fridays for a &ldquo;Rightpint&rdquo; Happy Hour? And we cater in lunch every other Friday? Those are just a few examples of what makes Rightpoint a truly great place to work.
