# CardsList Component

The `CardsList` component renders `Cards` in various layouts.

It is intended to be used as a wrapper for `Card` components.

It provides a stable component to connect with the CMS, so that content authors can choose different rendering options without re-uploading a new component.

It allows for dynamic layout component swapping based on other data such as quantity (e.g. larger display for 1 card, auto switch to carousel at 5+ etc.)
