# Links

The link content model is used to represent all links on the site.

Examples of some its features:

-   Link by reference
    -   Automatically loads pages linked in viewport in the background
    -   Loads next page without a page load
-   Open in new tab behavior
-   Scroll to text on target page

## Link reference

The link model has a reference field which points to contentful pages. The system will resolve the URL used for the referenced page.

For example, if a link reference points to a `Work Detail` page, the system will resolve the URL as `/work-detail/some-work-url`.

## ðŸš« Do not use custom URL unless absolutely necessary

The custom URL field should only be used to target external links.

Cons of using a custom URL:

-   Performance costs
-   User experience suffers due to page load
-   URL must be maintained, and may become stale
