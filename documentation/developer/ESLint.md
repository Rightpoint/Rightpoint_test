# ESLint

Read SOP: Linting [Read](/documentation/developer/Standard-Operating-Procedures/SOP-Linting.md)

# Shared configuration

To keep standardized linting across the project, shared configurations are stored in the `eslint` local package to be consumed by other packages.

# Custom configuration

Packages may have custom configuration files to override the shared configuration. [Read more](/documentation/developer/Standard-Operating-Procedures/SOP-Linting.md) for more information.
